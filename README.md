# How to Run

To run hamgame.py, have Arcade and Pillow installed. The game uses the graphics in this folder.

# Description

This is a maze game designed to look like Hamilton campus. The objective of each level (there is only one currently) is to get from the start of the maze to the end of the maze. I am working on making it so the player can only move within the path of the maze.

# Keys

The player moves using the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys.
